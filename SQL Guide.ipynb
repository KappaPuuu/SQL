    "> `SELECT MAX(pages), title FROM books;` <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately,**THIS WILL NOT WORK!** It will show only the a row of data, with a correct MAX pages, but not the correct title.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, then how about we put it in the `WHERE` clause:\n",
    "> `SELECT title FROM books` <br>\n",
    "> **`WHERE pages = MAX(pages);`**\n",
    "\n",
    "> return: `ERROR 1111 (HY000): Invalid use of group function`\n",
    "\n",
    "F, we cannot use MIN()/MAX() function like this. So what do we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's introduce the concept of **SUBQUERIES**.\n",
    "> `SELECT title FROM books` <br>\n",
    "> **`WHERE pages`** = **`(SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books);`**\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that, essentially, this will first run the subqueries **`(SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books);`** to get the MIN()/MAX() value, and THEN run the original query.\n",
    "However, note that this method is **SLOW**, since it basically runs **two queries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we can also do is go back to our old friends `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` to help us, simply using:\n",
    "> `SELECT title FROM books`<br>\n",
    "> `ORDER BY pages ASC` <br>\n",
    "> `LIMIT 1;`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will also give us the exactly same result we want, **quicker**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one take-a-way of this problem is that we don't always need to use the most complicated method or syntax or whatever to get our result. Instead, there might be other eaiser way to solve the problem simply by combining and utilizing what we've learned."
